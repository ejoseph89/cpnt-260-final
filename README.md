## Critique and additional help from Nhat

This project initialy only had one css file. My plan was to structure the HTML in a way that I can use the same/similar structure for all/most of the pages. For this, I considered a lot of styles as 'utilities' and decided to keep them common for multiple pages. For example, 'container' is a class name that I used to nest content to keep centering consistent in all pages. There are several other such examples. I believe this would have been helpful if I kept all my css in one file. But I decided to make seperate files for css, and in the process of doing that, the common, utility classes are kept in the main css file. The css for the 'register' page will look extremely short, becase that page's main content - the form is styled original in 'contact'. The form was further developed for the login page, and basically recycled for the register page.
